# Subagent Research Digest

## What was done

Parallel research streams were run for:

1. Redox microkernel feasibility and hardware realities
2. Samsung flashing pathways and constraints (S10+ baseline -> S24+ expansion)
3. Orchestration stack and model-routing architecture

## Consolidated outcomes

- Redox: strategic R&D value, limited direct fit for Samsung phone image pipeline.
- Samsung: S10+ has strongest documented baseline; newer generations require strict per-model qualification.
- Orchestration: Rig-first architecture with deterministic chain patterns and dual-vendor model verification.

## Evidence handling

- Key claims were cross-checked with official/vendor/project docs in `Docs/governance/source_verification.md`.
- Claims with weaker source quality are explicitly marked lower confidence in research files.
